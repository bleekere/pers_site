Literary archives wield a nearly irresistible attraction: they are troves of paper treasures, scattered with clues about past cultures and societies. Artefacts like manuscripts, codices and letters offer a brief kaleidoscopic view of times gone by.  Computational technologies provide great opportunities to store this wealth of information and make our literary heritage more accessible, but the archives do not give away their secrets easily. Like all histories, the story of our literary heritage is indeed a complex one. 

Our current understanding of and interaction with textual objects is affected by cultural, social, and political trends: the grounds for selecting, interpreting and presenting literary texts have varied greatly over the years. Archival boxes filled to the brim with seemingly negligible scraps of paper recount the lives of long-forgotten authors and their works. Who nowadays has heard of Margot Scharten-Antink? Who remembers the life and works of Til Brugman? These and other writers were active part of the literary world, but over the past decennium they disappeared from our collective memory. Their whole oeuvre, the works which they loved and cherished and for which they fought, nowÂ lies in a few archival boxes in the depot of the Literary Museum. If we blow the dust of these boxes and look within, we find not only their story, but that of many others like them. We'll learn about the workings of the past literary world: the publishers, the reviewers, the tastes of the reader audience and the writers who, with various success, tried to make a living ... 

Although we will never be able to fully understand or reconstruct the past in all its rich nuances, by allowing more than one interpretation of text we can create at least a new consciousness of the complexities involved in shaping our literary history.
