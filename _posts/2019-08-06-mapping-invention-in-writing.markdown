In the French animation movie [Le Tableau (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1891769/), three groups of characters co-exist within the painting of a castle: the Toupins (“tout peints”; completely finished), the Pafinis (“pas finis”; not entirely finished) and the Reufs (who are only roughly sketched). The Toupins rule the castle and consider themselves superior. After all, they are the only ones the painter completed, and he must have had his reasons for that. They consider the Pafinis and the Reufs not interesting or even unworthy of existence. In their turn, the Pafinis and the Reufs long for the painter to return and finish his work: surely it could not have been his intention to leave them like that?

In the history of textual scholarship, there was a time when the views of the Toupins were widely accepted. The latest or final version of a text was considered to represent the author’s intention; his draft manuscripts were of little to no interest. Scholars studied the available textual Toupins and selected the best one, or created a new one themselves.


More recently, and especially in the case of modern manuscripts, textual scholars started to appreciate the rough sketches, first outlines, or partly finished texts. These brouillons contain valuable information about the creation and shaping of a text and illustrate the wanderings of the author’s mind. They offer an understanding of writing as a spontaneous and fluid process, continually subject to change. Scholarly editors looked further, into marginalia and reading notes. They scrutinized pages, documenting all erasures, deletions and additions. They tracked every textual trail the author left behind, thus reconstructing the genesis of a literary work. The study of this is a way to bring the author closer, to see thought during its functioning, to see the shaping of ideas.

Yet, how to convey this knowledge to the reader? In my [PhD dissertation](https://anet.be/submit.phtml?UDses=93914160%3A834894&UDstate=1&UDmode=&UDaccess=&UDrou=%25Start:bopwexe&UDopac=opacuantwerpen&UDextra=c:lvd:14796991) called "Mapping Invention in Writing" (2017), I examined the ways in which digital scholarly editions could function as a research environment to study and present textual genesis. In short, how scholarly editors can capture the lives of the Reufs, the Pafinis as well as the Toupins.

 Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
 
 {% highlight ruby %}
 def print_hi(name)
   puts "Hi, #{name}"
 end
 print_hi('Tom')
 #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
 {% endhighlight %}
